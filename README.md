### ✔️ Compiling/Running Instructions                   
<br>
####    1)   Iterative Deepening                    

<p align="left"> 
Make sure that in your terminal you have navigated to the 'iterativeDeepening' folder. Then, to COMPILE:
</p> 
                
```
javac Graph.java
```
                    
<p align="left"> 
Make sure that 'Graph.java' has compiled successfully (There now exists a 'Graph.class' file in 'iterativeDeepening' folder) and make sure that 'input.txt' is also in the 'iterativeDeepening' folder. Then, to RUN:
</p> 
                       
```
java Graph.java
```
<br>
####    1)   Hill Climbing                    

<p align="left"> 
Make sure that in your terminal you have navigated to the 'hillClimbing' folder. Then, to COMPILE:
</p> 
                
```
javac Graph.java
```
                    
<p align="left"> 
Make sure that 'Graph.java' has compiled successfully (There now exists a 'Graph.class' file in 'hillClimbing' folder) and make sure that 'input.txt' is also in the 'hillClimbing' folder. Then, to RUN:
</p> 
                       
```
java Graph.java
```
