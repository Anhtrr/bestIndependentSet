Make sure that in your terminal you have navigated to the 'iterativeDeepening' folder. Then, to COMPILE:
</pre> 
                
```
javac Graph.java
```
                    
<pre align="left"> 
Make sure that 'Graph.java' has compiled successfully (There now exists a 'Graph.class' file in 'iterativeDeepening' folder) and make sure that 'input.txt' is also in the 'iterativeDeepening' folder. Then, to RUN:
</pre> 
```
java Graph.java
```
